To my knowledge, the account was on autopay from a linked Wells Fargo checking account, just as it has been since the inception of this mortgage. I immediately paid the past-due amount and re-initiated autopay in that moment. 

Subsequent communication with customer service resulted in a false accusation that I previously disabled autopay via the online portal. I did not this action and there is no written or digital verification of this action. I keep a very high cash balance in my Wells Fargo checking account and would have no reason to sabotage my own credit or banking relationship. I asked why Wells Fargo hadnt attempted to contact me directly before levying late fees and reporting the late payment to consumer credit bureaus. I was informed that the only attempts to contact me had been made via unidentified XXXX numbers who do not leave voicemails. I received no written communication via US mail as of that date, email, the secure Wells Fargo online message portal, text message, or voicemail. Yet, in the absence of any real communication, Wells Fargo found no issue finding time to impose late fees and report a late payment to consumer credit bureaus. 

After disputing the late payment reporting, Wells Fargo has refused to amend the credit reporting despite the fact that they are directly responsible for the late payment.

I am now in the 9th month with no resolution. I have answered the same questions over and over. I have sent all requested paperwork in duplicate and triplicate. I have spoken with them weekly to resolve any issues. 

When I called to check on my loan status in XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that I had already called in on XX/XX/XXXX to cancel all activity on my loan and that I was no longer interested in a loan modification. I did not talk with anyone at Chase at all on that date. Since all calls are recorded, I have requested to hear the recording of this call. My case was closed. After escalation of my complaint and transfer to another department, the account was supposedly reopened, however all documentation would need to be resent. So we effectively started from the beginning. 

Chase can not be this accidently inefficient. My application is clearly being treated in a delaying and fraudulent manner. Each time I call I speak with a different representative. I have been assigned at least 4 Relationship Managers ( Ive spoken with one ). I received 2 copies of my appraisal in XX/XX/XXXX one day apart, and another copy in XX/XX/XXXX. Letters are erratic, stating that information is complete and then it is not.

In summary, I have been shuffled around from department to department, talked to multiple people making duplicative requests, sent and resent income documentation multiple times, been driven into default due to inability to finalize refinance request, been told that my refinance request was closed, claiming I called and requested they do so, been denied recording evidence of my call that the refinance request be closed, been offered reinstatement of the refinance request ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) with a non-committal expectation to have a final response on approval within the next 30-45 days ( the same time frame provided at the time I opened my initial request 9 months ago ), been offered no further apology or admission of fault. 

I would not be in this position at all if I had not been advised by Chase back in XX/XX/XXXX that a home equity loan would be better for me than my requested conventional mortgage. ( It would then not be qualified for the automatic loan modifications that followed the XX/XX/XXXX recession. ) Recent Chase advice specified that if I did not qualify for modification under this current application, I would need to be at least 4 months in arrears before looking at other options. Since the loan process would be completed within a 45 day period ( per Chase ), I stopped making payments on the property to cover this possibility.

I read messages from a variety of members and it seemed to me that they are all happy making money. The group was apparently a collection of investors following trading direction from someone named XXXX XXXX ( aka. XXXX XXXX XXXX- XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and It seemed legit. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I asked the group how to become a member. Someone who is the head of the group answered me back. Her name is XXXX XXXX last name unknown ). She told me there is no Membership fee.

XXXX I started trading with XXXX XXXX. The first transaction I made was almost XXXX. I told her that it was easy. She said, but of course in every investment there is a risk. I was convinced to put more money into my account. She said that the following week is the big Layout meaning we can make more money. The more money in your account the more money you can make, XXXX XXXX XXXX helped me again to buy XXXX XXXX from my XXXX account.

XXXX texted the investment group through XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, You can withdraw all the funds in your account including the profit to your bank card, and then settle the club commission with me. 
My understanding was that we can withdraw all the funds in the account including the profit and then settle the club commission with her. 
So she helped me initiate a transfer of {$490000.00} ( which included my initial investment plus gain. ) from their platform XXXX or XXXX account to my XXXX account. Using XXXX  XXXX address : XXXX I was waiting for the money to arrive in XXXX, minutes later I texted her that the money was not in XXXX yet and it was taking too long. 
XXXX told me that I have to pay the commission of {$53000.00} to her first before they can release the money despite the fact she described this account as my account. I told her I dont have additional funds in my bank and that I was planning on paying the commission from the earnings. She told me, That was the agreement that I pay the {$53000.00} before they can release my money to XXXX. We had many text conversations that evening of Friday XX/XX/XXXX, the whole day Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and now Sunday XX/XX/XXXX. I requested that they release the XXXX to XXXX to settle the commission on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX responded on XX/XX/XXXX that my request was denied and the rules should not be broken. Anyone withdrawing funds is required to settle the commision first. 

I told her I have a friend who is willing to help me pay my commision. XXXX had texted me before that she is from New York. 
I told her that my friend lives in New Jersey and works in XXXX. She is willing to give you a cashier check and you release my money and I will be able to pay her back. She wants your address and telephone number and she can meet you tomorrow or Tuesday. XXXX did not agree. 

So, at this point they are holding my funds, requiring a commission payment be made through a cryptocurrency address. 
I believe that they have no intention in returning my money.

We have the signed returned receipt but still have not received any bill, invoice or any proof of dept from them. We can not continue paying them for a bill we do not owe this has been going on for years. 

About one year later of our sending out the certified mail, I was notified by Stern & Stern that there was a judgement again my property and a lien on my house. I thought it was a scam, it took me weeks of working with my local town government to confirm that their is indeed a lien on our property. I believe that they may be targeting senior citizens because I recently found another complaint on XXXX reviews for the same law firm representing the same tax company describing Stern and Stern 's use of unscrupulous tactics. 

I asked my bank if it would be possible to return that far back in my banking history and they informed me that NY state has 6 year statue of limitations on collecting dept so that it should not be necessary for me to go through this trouble. I do not understand how they could legally place a lien on our property for a dept that exceeds the state 's statue of limitations.

My life saving of so far {$14000.00} has been taken from me by a hacker or thief through Wells Fargo and XXXX. I have run into an enormous amount of customer service challenges in the processing of my claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I turned my personal debit card off in my possession in hopes to save up and only spend the cash I had at hand. The very next day my account was hacked and someone who's name and contact information are listed in an email later sent by Wells Fargo stating this person has added themselves to my account as a deposit recipient through XXXX. I believe the same person then turned my card back on, changed my username and password, and lastly upped my spending limit per day. From there the below will explain the chain of events after. 
A transaction was made using a card created by someone at an ATM near my home XX/XX/22 The card was then taken to a XXXX in XXXX Ga, an hour, and a half from my home where someone inserted my card 4 times in a row withdrawing {$1000.00} cash back at a time. I was not notified once of those transaction. XX/XX/22 on XX/XX/22 the card was taken to a XXXX in XXXX Ga, 15 mins from the day before, and 5 transactions were made there. Again 5 transaction of {$1000.00} cash back at a time. Still no red flags reported to me. 
Random charges spanned on for 2 weeks, including charges up to {$500.00} at grocery stores and 2-day hotel rentals. 
3 checks were also mailed to me which is when I looked into my account and emails to find my account in disarray. These checks were fraudulent checks sent by Wells Fargo, that had been attempted to be deposited into my account. Check amounts totaling over {$27000.00}. ( Please reminder I am a 20 year who has no way of receiving a {$8000.00} check from a private investigator from NY. ) Once I was aware of my account being drained, I contacted Wells fargo and filed a claim. I was advised by 3 different employees of Wells Fargo that I would not need a police report and I would receive assistance. After roughly a week I called requesting an update on my claim and was told I would have to leave a number and the High value department would call me back within 10 days. I did not accept that and was then sent to a gentleman who told me I owed them the over drafted amount and Wells Fargo no longer wanted to do business with me. And advised if I didn't agree with him, I should file a claim. I informed him I had already done that. He them decided to ready my account notes and said, direct quote "" oh then wait tell they tell you in the mail. '' then hung up. I called back with someone informing me someone would call me back in 1 to 2 business days. 
The next day I called back and was informed my claim was denied with absolutely no explanation. I was told to wait for a letter. Three letters came with 2 different claim numbers and amounts with the explanation of a physical card was used so it could not have been fraud. There is apparently no further process to investigate if the decision was wrong. I called Wells Fargo and was told my claim could not be re-opened or helped and I could not be further helped. After a manager was requested, I was sarcastically and condescendingly told by XXXX, there is nothing else the bank will do.

I know that they are taking out interest fees for each payment that they have not earned yet.

905913,2020-12-31,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"Last year I was a victum of identify theft. Supposed someone used my identity to have XXXX XXXX XXXX in my name. So XXXX XXXX turned me into collections and that's how I found about all this. So ok I completed a police report, FTC identity theft report, Identify theft dispute letter, Copy of credit report, Fair credit credit reporting act 609e, FTC notice of furnishings, Copy of my ID, and faxed all this info to XXXX with the supplied fax number they told me to send it too. I'm including proof attached. Ok fast forward a few weeks after that all 3 credit reporting agencies XXXX, XXXX, ,XXXX and the dept collector at that time XXXX XXXX XXXX they all removed and deleted the dept from my credit report all around XXXX. So I thought this nightmare was over. Well fast forward to today XXXX I was recently getting calls on my phone from different collection companies calling about this same dept that was deleted off my credit report on XXXX well XXXX the original collector must of not wanted to delete this so they must of sold the debt to other collection agency 's because the same dept is back on my credit report with different collections companies calling me saying I owe debt when I don't. So XXXX currently refuses to end this even though I sent all the needed documentation to them with proof this was identify theft. A few key notes I would like to provide please. I have talked to so many XXXX people on the phone most of of them agree this is crazy and just the information they have about this whole thing they can see its clearly fraud and was not me. I never lived in Kansas, never had a XXXX account in my life, Clearly its not hard for XXXX to see whom lived in this place in question the phone reps told me yes they don't see my name ever anywhere around this address. They know it was not me yet they refuse too take action. Also should be noted I'm the one whom first called XXXX and gave them all my info, my address my phone number my ssn my email basically any info they wanted because they dint know nothing about me because I never used them before that's why. OK heres another fact seems to me if someone was getting Cable services and equipment then a persons ID would be checked and copied so I asked them ok is someone walking around with my ID and they would not answer. Clearly XXXX dint check anything otherwise they would of seen my ID has been the same address since XXXX in MI. And again XXXX knew nothing about me until I called them and gave all my info to them that alone proves they had no ID. So if you ask me with the facts presenting themselves someone either just used my name and SSN to get services and XXXX dint check anything if they did they would of had my ID and known how to contact me. XXXX wont release any info to me because they know this is fraud either on XXXX Part or Identify theft some one using my SSN that's why I did the identify theft report and police report because I had these charges on my credit report and XXXX claims someone was using my info. Very important to state XXXX will not send me any proof of anything even though I sent them a notice of furnishings in the 17 pages I faxed them on info they was requesting. It would of been nice to know if someone is walking around Kansas with a fake ID pretending to be me or was this all just made up by XXXX and they pinned it on my and my SSN that someone just said and that's all XXXX asked for. XXXX needs to be investigated for fraudulent behavior on this account. I tried with all my power with XXXX emailing all sorts of info, documents and it falls on deaths ears. Ok this brings me too the lastest information today. Yesterday On XXXX I filled out the Identity theft verification form I guess XXXX Is now using online stuff so I filled it out again including 7 documents again, police report. FTC id theft, Copies of my ID this current one issued XXXX-XXXX and my old ID that was issued XXXX-XXXX both have same addresses as I lived here since XXXX just to prove hey here 's my addresses is has not changed. So more game playing by XXXX as this email comes back today with a ladie from the Fraud Analyst department at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX KS. office number XXXX that's the person I guess in charge of account now. She said I need 2 proofs of residency between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and a notarized affidavit I told her on the phone you received everything you need and then some but these people will not budge they are crooks and need investigating. I have wasted {$16.00} dollars of my own money faxing everything they asked for back on XXXX, I have followed all rules by the book with a FTC id theft report, a police report, Sending XXXX copies of my ID, several calls to XXXX on the phone giving all my info trying to get this straight telling them any info they want, my credit has been affected severely, the stress these people have put on me is crazy, I get phone calls from debt collectors only to be hung up on when I try to explain this is fraud identify theft, I spent several hours of my time emailing sending documents.
