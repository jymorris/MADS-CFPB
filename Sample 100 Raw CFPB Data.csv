2016-02-11,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"To start, I have repeatedly asked Wells Fargo reps to opt me out of overdraft protection ( as I had been repeatedly enrolled into it automatically ). This finally happened last year when I was told that occasionally charges would still go through ( due to "" systemic '' issues ), and if that were to happen, I should come into the branch to get any overdraft charges reversed. This happened once on XXXX, three times on XXXX, and twice on XXXX. I went into the bank to get these overdraft charges reversed and was told something new, that overdraft protection only applies to charges that are made from my debit/credit card and not to charges routed through the bank account like checks. Since the charges were made from my XXXX card, which routes through my bank account, my account was overdrawn. Additionally, after Wells Fargo initially approved the charges ( against what I had been told would happen ), they then cancelled the payment the following day. When I asked why the bank first approved the payment and then cancelled it, I was told by a rep that Wells Fargo "" tries to be helpful '' by "" giving me until the end of the day to cover the cost of the charge. '' When I said that first approving the charge and then cancelling it was not helpful ( I would have no reason to put money into the account if it is not supposed to be overdrawn, and in this case I was not notified that an overdraft charge was approved until the next day ) I was told, "" That is how banks work. '' When I pressed on this issue, and asked why does n't this bank just not approve charges if there is no money in the account, I was told "" That is just not Wells Fargo 's policy. '' It got even worse from here - after Wells Fargo initially approved and then cancelled the payment, XXXX ran the same XXXX transactions, which were again approved, again incurred fees, and again cancelled at the end of the day. This racked up a total of {$350.00} in overdraft fees, only half of which the bank reversed.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,WA,98125,,Consent provided,Web,2016-02-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1784611

After 6 months of continuous waiting and no status updates ( approx. XXXX XXXX, 2015 ) Chase finally acknowledged the contract and countered the original offer - we agreed. Finally, ( we thought XXXX things were on its way to being finalized. From there, the inspection was done- serious issues were addressed and being handled. That, in itself, took a little more time than we cognized and was eventually rectified. Next, the appraisal was done- it came back fine- with minor improvements to be done. After roughly 1 1/2 months of negotiating, my bank could now get my financing finalized ( I was preapproved for a {$7500.00} downpayment and closing cost grant ). I was also receiving an FHA loan and my paperwork could not be fully processed until all the repairs were improvised and/or rectified. While waiting to hear back from the grant approval team, we received an email from the seller 's agent ( approx.

My banker, the seller 's agent and my real estate agent were completely and utterly in shock by this unforseen action.

If anything, they could have explained their rational behind their actions. I could not have just exited the contract without reasoning in the middle of it.

2015-08-25,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Communication tactics,Used obscene/profane/abusive language,"To Whom It May ConcernRe : Complaint about unethical conduct of employees/possible owner ( s ) of Southern Management Systems , Inc. [ FEI/EIN # XXXX ] I have an apartment collections from XX/XX/XXXX and am in the process of finding a new place to live. On Tuesday [ XX/XX/XXXX ] I sought advice from the owner of the company I work for about how to pay a collections, i.e. what documentation to ask for, how to pay, etc. She offered to call and speak on my behalf. I found the name of the collector on creditkarma.com and gave the contact information to my boss. She called and the person who answered the phone informed her that I would have to call and give authorization for her to speak on my behalf. I called and spoke with someone named "" XXXX '' who I gave my information to and permission for my boss to call about my collection. 

On Wednesday [ XX/XX/XXXX ], I spoke with my boss, and she told me about the conversation she had with "" Extension 150 ''. I do not know the man 's name because he refused to give one. I will not try to recount exact quotes from the conversation because I wish to only give facts. It would be best to contact my boss directly to get a statement which she would happily provide if requested. The gist of it is that the man she spoke with was unbelievably rude and uncooperative. He made inappropriate comments about the quality of the apartment I currently live in due to having a collection on my record, implying that I live in a dump. He accused my boss of lying when she stated that I did not "" put her up '' to calling on my behalf. He was very aggressive and demeaning and did not present any options for me to pay my debt. He did not state the amount of the debt or who the original collector was. He did not discuss the details of my collection and spent the majority of the conversation hurling insults. He was very unprofessional and hung up the phone on my boss who then immediately called back and requested to speak with the manager. The woman who answered the phone refused to identify "" Extension 150 '' or a supervisor/manager and would not transfer my boss to anyone other than "" Extension 150 ''. 



According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 806 : '' A debt collector may not engage in any conduct the natural consequence of which is to harass, oppress, or abuse any person in connection with the collection of a debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 2 ) The use of obscene or profane language or language the natural consequence of which is to abuse the hearer or reader. "" The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act 802 also states : ( a ) There is abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices by many debt collectors. Abusive debt collection practices contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies, to marital instability, to the loss of jobs, and to invasions of individual privacy. 



( d ) Abusive debt collection practices are carried on to a substantial extent in interstate commerce and through means and instrumentalities of such commerce. Even where abusive debt collection practices are purely intrastate in character, they nevertheless directly affect interstate commerce. 



It is my understanding that the FDCPA was intended to eliminate abusive debt XXXX and to protect consumers from them. I am now afraid to contact this company to try to pay my debt because to me if a person is able to speak to customers in such an abusive manner, it must be a fake company. If XXXX was n't listed in Florida 's XXXX of Corporations, I would think this man was a scammer. If you read reviews about this company on the internet, you will find countless incidents of unprofessional and unethical behavior by employees of this company.

I contacted the courthouse to verify their information release policy. The court informed me that they do not provide anyone with a debtors full social security number and they do not provide ANY credit bureau ANY information about ANY bankruptcy cases. 

It is quite clear that someone from Equifax lied about verifying this bankruptcy with the courthouse. That is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

I went to a different location and brought all of my legal documents ( just in case ) then they opened a new account. That was Friday XX/XX/2019.
